An experiment with functional optics[fn:1].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A lens is a value that composes a getter and a setter function to produce a bidirectional view into a data structure. This definition is intentionally broad—lenses are a very general concept, and they can be applied to almost any kind of value that encapsulates data.
  -- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/lens/lens-intro.html][Racket 'lens' documentation]] 
#+END_QUOTE 

** Usage

To construct a lens:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # A lens for the key :name
  Lens.make_lens(:name)

  # A lens for the key "name"
  Lens.make_lens("name")

  # A lens for the second item in a tuple:
  Lens.make_lens(1)
#+END_SRC

Each lens provides both a getter and a setter for the accessor it was created for.

Lenses can be used to access and/or modify structured data:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # Extract a value from a simple map:

  person = %{name: "Homer"}
  nameLens = Lens.make_lens(:name)

  Lens.view(nameLens, person) 
  # "Homer"

  Lens.set(nameLens, person, "Bart")
  # %{name: "Bart"}

  Lens.over(nameLens, person, &String.upcase/1)
  # %{name: "HOMER"}
#+END_SRC

Their real utility comes in operating on nested data. Lenses can be created by composing other lenses in order to traverse a data structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  person = %{
    name: "Homer",
    address: %{
      locale: %{
        number: 742,
        street: "Evergreen Terrace",
        city: "Springfield",
      },
      state: "???"
    }
  }

  # To access the street, we can compose the lenses that lead there from the top level.
  # Lenses can be composed with Focus.compose/2, or the infix (~>) operator.

  address = Lens.make_lens(:address)
  locale =  Lens.make_lens(:locale)
  street =  Lens.make_lens(:street)

  address
  ~> locale
  ~> street
  |> Focus.view(person)
  # "Evergreen Terrace"

  address
  ~> locale
  ~> street
  |> Focus.set(person, "Fake Street")
  # person = %{
  #   name: "Homer",
  #   address: %{
  #     locale: %{
  #       number: 742,
  #       street: "Fake Street",
  #       city: "Springfield",
  #     },
  #     state: "???"
  #   }
  # }
#+END_SRC

** Installation

  1. Add =focus= to your list of dependencies in =mix.exs=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
      def deps do
        [{:focus, "~> 0.2.0"}]
      end
    #+END_SRC

  2. Ensure =focus= is started before your application:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
      def application do
        [applications: [:focus]]
      end
    #+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] This library currently combines Lenses and Prisms with Traversals in its implementation. Until v1.0.0, the API is subject to large and frequent change.
